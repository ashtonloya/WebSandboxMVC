                    Front-end Development
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Front-end development is the tier of full-stack development that deals with the visual elements of an application that a user interacts with. The three primary languages used are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to define the structure and content of a web page. Is is arguably the most important front-end language because without it there is no content and CSS and JavaScript have nothing to target.

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for the formatting and layout of page content. It was introduced as a way to seperate the concerns of markup (HTML) and formatting (CSS) into separate files.

                    <p>
                        JavaScript allows us to make our web pages more interactive. It is primarily used to perform programming logic on the front end, react to events, and validate form data.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Lorem ipsum is sample text that is sometimes used in the mock-up stage of website development before the actual hard copy has been created. It is used to lay out some text content on the page. Traditionally, it was written in Latin but there are now many alternatives.
