    CSS Syntax:
    selector {
    property: value;
    }

    We can target HTML to style in different ways
    1) by tag name
    2) by id: #idname
    3) by class name: .classname

    Classes and ids are developer defined
    IDs are intended to be used once per page, but classes are
    designed to be used as often as needed.

    CSS is case sensitive.

    We can incorporate CSS into our HTML pages in 3 ways
    1) INLINE styling - use the style attribute on a particular tag.
    2) INTERNAL Stylesheets - use style tags in the head element of the page
    3) EXTERNAL Stylesheets - use link tags in the head that point to a CSS stylesheet

    NOTE: IMPORTING style sheets - uses an @import at the top of an external
    stylesheet to link two stylesheets together. This practice is largely deprecated
    but you could see it in legacy code.

    We can target items to style in different ways
    1) target by tag name - most generic
    2) target by class name (.className) - more specific
    a. class selectors are denoted by a period
    b. they can be used as often as needed
    c. they are applied to html tags using the class attribute
    ex. <h1 class="alert">Alert</h1>
    3) target by id name (#IdName)
    a. id selectors denoted by a #
    b. should only be used once per page (unique identifiers)
    c. applied to HTML tags using the id attribute
    ex. <h1 id="Alert">Alert</h1>

    CSS precedence is the process of determining which rule set will win out
        when there are multiple rules targeting the same element. CSS has a
        cascading hierarchy where the most specific rules override conflicting
        rules of a lower specificity.
        - Proximity: the styling that is physically closest to the element has
        higher proximity (inline over internal, internal over external)
        - Specificity: How the element is being targeted. (id over class, class over tag)

        You can also combine selectors to increase specificity:
        - Compound selectors: apply formatting to a comma-seperated list of selectors
        Ex: h1, h2, h3 {color: purple;}
        - Descendant selectors: apply formatting to a selector that is nested in another
        selector in the order provided, space seperated, read right to left
        Ex: div h1 span {font-style: bold;}
        - Adjacent selectors: apply formatting to an element of a certain type with
        a specified class or id
        Ex: h2.headingStyle {font-family: wingding;}

                    <p>
                        Inline styles use the style attribute inside of an HTML tag. This is typically avoided, except in rare cases, because it isn't reusable. It uses semicolon-seperated, CSS property/value pairs in the attribute's value. Highest in terms of proximity and specificity but is the least reusable.

                    <p>
                        Internal style is defined inside the head of a page. It is more reusable, as the styling applies to the whole page. It is second in terms of proximity and specificity.

                    <p>
                        External styles are written in .css style sheets, which are brought into each page via a link in the head. This is best practice as it is reusable for the entire site. Lowest in terms of proximity and specificity.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Imported styling is done via an @import at the top of an external style sheet. It allows one style sheet to use styling from another one. This is rarely used, most typically when seperation of concerns is an issue or when using styling from a resource outside of the solution.
